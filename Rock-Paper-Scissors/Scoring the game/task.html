<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>People love to see their results as they're advancing to their goals. So, let's learn how to show the scoreboard! </p>
<p>When the game starts, users must be able to enter their names. After that, the program should greet users and read a file named <em>rating.txt</em>.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">In order to execute the test program correctly, name the file "rating.txt" and save it in the current directory, without subdirectories. In tests this file will be created, pre-filled with data. Make sure that you read the data correctly when you start the game</div>
<p>It is the file that contains the current scores for different players. You can see the file format below: lines containing usernames and their scores, divided by a single space:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Tim 350
Jane 200
Alex 400</code></pre>
<p>Take the current user score from the file and use it as a basis for counting the score during the game. For example, if a user entered <code class="java">Tim</code>, then their score at the start of the game is <code class="java">350</code>. If a user inputs a name that is not on the list, the program should count the score from <code class="java">0</code>. </p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">No need to write anything to the <em>rating.txt</em> file.</div>
<p>Print the user score with the <code class="java">!rating</code> command. For example, if your rating is <code class="java">0</code>, then the program should print:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Your rating: 0</code></pre>
<p>Add <code class="java">50</code> points for every draw, <code class="java">100</code> for every win, and <code class="java">0</code> for losing.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Your program should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Output a line <code class="java">Enter your name:</code>. Users enter their names on the same line (not the one following the output!);</li>
<li>Read input with the name and output a new line: <code class="java">Hello, &lt;name&gt;</code></li>
<li>Read <em>rating.txt </em>and check whether it contains an entry with the current username. If yes, use the score specified in the file as a starting point. If not, start the score from <code class="java">0</code>.</li>
<li>Play the game by the rules defined in the previous stages and read the user input;</li>
<li>If the input is <code class="java">!exit</code>, output <code class="java">Bye!</code> and stop the game;</li>
<li>If the input is the name of the option, then pick a random option and output a line with the result in the following format (<code class="java">&lt;option&gt;</code> is the name of the option chosen by the program):
	<ul>
<li>Loss: <code class="java">Sorry, but the computer chose &lt;option&gt;</code></li>
<li>Draw: <code class="java">There is a draw (&lt;option&gt;)</code></li>
<li>Win: <code class="java">Well done. The computer chose &lt;option&gt; and failed</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For each draw, add <code class="java">50</code> points to the score. For each win, add <code class="java">100</code> points. In case a user loses, don't change the score; </li>
<li>If the input corresponds to anything else, output <code class="java">Invalid input</code>;</li>
<li>Restart the game.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
